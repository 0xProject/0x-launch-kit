## Quick Start

0x Launch Kit is the easiest way to create your own 0x-based cryptoasset exchange. Use one of our beautifully-crafted UIs as is, edit one to meet your needs, or build your own, all using our professionally-engineered backend to manage, validate, and serve 0x orders.

### [ERC-721 Live Mainnet Demo](https://demo.0x.org/marketplace)

#### Pre-requirements

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) > v8.x
-   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) > v1.x
-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
-   [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx)

1. Run the wizard and load the Docker image

```
npx @0x/launch-kit-wizard && docker-compose up
```

2. When Docker is done loading, and the frontend image is done building, open your browser to check out your new exchange. It will be running at the port you specified in the wizard (default is http://localhost:3001/)

## Introduction

Launch a 0x relayer in under a minute with Launch Kit. This repository contains an open-source, free-to-use 0x relayer template that you can use as a starting point for your own project.

-   Quickly launch a market for your community token
-   Seemlessly create an in-game marketplace for digital items and collectibles
-   Enable trading of any ERC-20 or ERC-721 asset

Launch Kit is split into two separate repos:

-   **[0x Launch Kit Frontend](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-launch-kit-frontend)**: ERC-20 and ERC-721 relayer UIs
-   **[0x API](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-api)**: An API that supports the [Standard Relayer API](https://0x.org/docs/api#sra) specification.

This repo contains a Docker image that will run both codebases simultaneously for easy deployment, but you can also clone or fork each repo independently.

### [See website](https://0x.org/launch-kit)

## Language choice

`0x-api` is a Typescript node codebase that uses Express to run an HTTP server.

`0x-launch-kit-frontend` is a TypeScript codebase and uses React + Thunk to create and manage the UI.

## Windows
Note some installations of Docker on windows don't support forwarding `localhost` to the Docker VM. You may be required to update references of `localhost` to `192.168.99.100` or the `docker-machine ip` equivalent. These values should be replaced during the Wizard prompts and when navigating to the frontend website.
