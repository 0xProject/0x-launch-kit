## Quick Start

0x Launch Kit is the easiest way to create your own 0x-based cryptoasset exchange. Use one of our beautifully-crafted UIs as is, edit one to meet your needs, or build your own, all using our professionally-engineered backend to manage, validate, and serve 0x orders.

## Introduction

Launch a 0x relayer in under a minute with Launch Kit. This repository contains an open-source, free-to-use 0x relayer template that you can use as a starting point for your own project.

-   Quickly launch a market for your community token
-   Seemlessly create an in-game marketplace for digital items and collectibles
-   Enable trading of any ERC-20 or ERC-721 asset

Launch Kit is split into two separate repos:

-   **[0x Launch Kit Frontend](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-launch-kit-frontend)**: ERC-20 and ERC-721 relayer UIs
-   **[0x Launch Kit Backend](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-launch-kit-backend)**: 0x relayer server, API, and database that powers Launch Kit

This repo contains a Docker image that will run both codebases simultaneously for easy deployment, but you can also clone or fork each repo independently.

### [See website](https://0xproject.com/launch-kit)

## Language choice

`0x-launch-kit-backend` ships with 2 codebases, one in Typescript and another in Javascript. Although the Javascript is auto-generated from the Typescript, we made sure the Javascript generated is readable.

`0x-launch-kit-frontend` ship with just a TypeScript codebase and uses React + Thunk to create and manage the UI.
